# FirstSolContract
This is my first contract in solidity. Uploading this as part of my submission to an online course.

## Description
I have created a simple token, called Mahala. It has some public variables and a mapping instance to check balances of different adddresses. 
Token has 2 functions as of now - mint and burn. Mint function mints _value instances of the token and burn does the opposite.
